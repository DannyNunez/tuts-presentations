###The Purpose of SCRUM

Scrum is a framework for developing ans sustainin g complex products. 

###Definition of Scrum

Scrum(n):  A framework within which can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest value. 

Scrum is: 

* Lightweight
* Simple to understand 
* Difficult to master

Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. 

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles , events, artifacts and rules. 

###Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. 

Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. 

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. 

Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control. 

**Transparency**

Significant aspects of the process must be visiable to those responsible for the outcome. 

Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen. 

Those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common
definition of “Done”.

**Inspection**
**Adaptation**

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described inspection and adaptation. 

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

###The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. 

Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. 

Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. 

Cross functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. 

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity. 

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of
working product is always available.
