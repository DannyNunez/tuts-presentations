Language constructs elements that are built into the language and, therefore, follow special rules. Perhaps the most common of them is the echo statement, which allows you to write data to the scripts output: 

```
echo "A string"; // will output a string
```

The echo construct may optionally use parentheses, but they are not required, and in fact must be omitted when you pass more than one argument.
