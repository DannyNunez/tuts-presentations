Data Types:
=============

PHP supports many different data types, but they are generally divided into two categories. 


####Scalar Types 

A scalar data type contains only one value at a time. PHP supports four scalar types. 


*boolean* A value that can only be either true or false 

*init* A signed numeric integer value

*float* A signed floating-point value 

*string* A collection of binary data
