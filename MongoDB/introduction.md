###Key Features

####High Performance 
MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

* Support for embedded data models reduces I/0 activity on system.
* Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays. 

####High Availability

To provide high availability, MongoDB's replication facility, called replica sets, provide:

* automatic failover
* data redundancy

####Replica Set
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same dataset, providing redundancy and increasing data availability. 

####Automatic Scaling

MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality

* Automatic sharding distributes data across a cluster of machine
* Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for lower latency high throughput deployments
