##Managing text-centric data

###Text-centric 

###Read-dominant

A key aspect of data that search engines handle effectively is that data is read dominate and therefor intended to accessed efficiently, as apposed to updated frequently. 

Think of read-dominant as meaning that documents are read far more often than they're created or updated. 

One of the key features in SOLR 4 is near real-time search, which allows you to index thousands of documents per second and have them be searchable almost immediately. 

###Document-oriented

Solr has a flat structure.

In Solr a field can have multiple values but fields don't contain subfields.
