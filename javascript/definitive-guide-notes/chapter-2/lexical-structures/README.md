What are Lexical Structures? 


The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary rules that specifies how you write programmes in that language. 

It is the lowest-level syntax of a language. 

It specifies such things as what variable names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one program statement is separated from the next. 

#####Character Set:

Javascript application are written using the Unicode Character Set.


####Case Sensitive: 

- JavaScript is case sensitive 
- Distinct Variables
-- online
-- Online
-- OnLine
-- ONLINE 


####Whitespace , Line Breaks, and Format Control Characters 

JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens in program. 

####Comments 

Javascript supports two styles of comments. Ant text between a // and the end os a line is treated a a comment and ia ignored by JavaScript. 

####Literals 

A *Literal* is a data value that appears directly in a a program.

12 - The number 12
1.2 - The number one point two
"hello world" 'Hi' - A string of text.
true -  A boolean Value
false - The Other Boolean Value
/javascript/gi  - A "regular expression" Literal (for pattern matching)
null  - The Absence of an object. 
{ x:1,y:2} - An object initializer
{1,2,3,4,5} - An array initializer

- arrays  
- strings
- objects 

####Identifiers and Reserved Words 

An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript Code.
A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore _ , or a dollar sign $.
Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. 
Numbers are not allowed as the first character so that JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers. 

#Reserved Words

JavaScript reserves a number of identifiers as the keywords of the language itself. You cannot use thes words as identifiers in your programs. 

break
case
catch
continue
debugger
default
delete
do
else
false
finally
for
function
if
in
instanceof
new
null
return
switch
this
throw
true
try
typeof
var
void
while
with 

JavaScript also reserves certain keywords that are not currently used by the language but which might be used in future versions. 

class
const
enum
export
extends
import 
super
