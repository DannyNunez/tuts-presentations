#Types, Values and Variables


JavaScript Types can be devided into two categories: primitive types and object types. 
JavaScripts primitive types include numbers, strints of text,
and booleans. 

The Specail JS values null and undefined are primitive values. but they are not numbers, strings or booleans. 

##Objects
Any JS value that is not a number string boolean , or null or undefined is an object. 

An object, is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value (either a primative value such as a number or string, or an object).

An ordinary JS object is an unordered collection of named values. JS also defines a special object know as an array. 
The array object represents and ordered collection of numbered values.
